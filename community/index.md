OrbitDB has an active developer community. Your best place to find us is on Gitter TODO.

## Biweekly Calls

We have a fortnightly community call every other Tuesday. The time, date and other info for each week's call is announced [in an issue in this repository](https://github.com/orbitdb/welcome/issues). Propose agenda items for the call by commenting on the issue!

Consult the [OrbitDB calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=orbitdb.org_olkqirjqok6ptbn6p1pekvd2go%40group.calendar.google.com) for the scheduled dates.

## Code of Conduct

We're dedicated to having a safe, awesome community. We have a Code of Conduct that enshrines what we value, and what we tolerate in our community spaces - here, on Twitter, on Gitter, and so on. Go [read it](https://github.com/orbitdb/welcome/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!
