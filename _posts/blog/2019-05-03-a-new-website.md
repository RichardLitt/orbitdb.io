Welcome to the OrbitDB blog!

It's about time that OrbitDB has its own website. While the community docs and the code [live on GitHub](https://github.com/orbitdb), we also have a fair amount of users who may not be familiar with code, and may want to know about more high-level aspects of the OrbitDB community.

That's what we'll put here. Blog posts about stuff going on, and links to places you can get involved.

All of the code for this website is, of course, open source. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb.org). And you can contribute any time you like. [Open an issue!](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb.org/issues/new)
